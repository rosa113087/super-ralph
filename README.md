# Super-Ralph

**Ralph's autonomous development loop + Superpowers' disciplined methodology = production-ready autonomous AI development.**

Super-Ralph fuses two proven open-source projects into a unified system:

- **[Ralph](https://github.com/frankbria/ralph-claude-code)** (MIT) -- An autonomous AI development loop for Claude Code with intelligent exit detection, rate limiting, circuit breakers, session continuity, and a comprehensive bash-based orchestration system (465+ tests, 100% pass rate).
- **[Superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers)** (MIT) -- A composable skills framework and software development methodology that enforces brainstorming, TDD, systematic debugging, two-stage code review, and verification-before-completion workflows across AI coding agents.

Ralph gives your AI agent **endurance** (it can run autonomously for hours). Superpowers gives it **discipline** (it follows engineering best practices instead of ad-hoc implementation). Super-Ralph combines both.

## Why Super-Ralph Exists

Ralph alone is a powerful autonomous loop, but it has gaps that Superpowers fills:

| Ralph Default | Super-Ralph Enhancement |
|---------------|------------------------|
| Jumps straight to implementation | Brainstorms design first, validates with user |
| Tests as afterthought | Enforces strict TDD: test first, watch fail, implement |
| Works on main branch | Uses git worktrees for isolation |
| Reviews code informally | Two-stage review: spec compliance then code quality |
| "Fix plan says done" = done | Verification-before-completion: evidence before claims |
| Serial task execution | Subagent-driven development with fresh agents per task |
| Guesses at bug fixes | Systematic 4-phase debugging: root cause before fix |
| No structured planning | Bite-sized tasks with exact file paths and commands |

---

## What's Inside

### Bash System (Ralph Infrastructure)

The bash system replicates and extends Ralph's autonomous loop infrastructure:

| Component | File | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| **Main Loop** | `super_ralph_loop.sh` | The autonomous development loop. Runs Claude Code in a loop with rate limiting (configurable calls/hour), circuit breaker pattern (stops after repeated failures), intelligent exit detection (dual-condition gate: completion indicators + EXIT_SIGNAL), and session continuity. Injects superpowers methodology context via `--append-system-prompt` on every iteration. Operates in dual mode: reuses Ralph's libraries when installed, or runs standalone with built-in infrastructure. |
| **Skill Selector** | `lib/skill_selector.sh` | Classifies tasks from `fix_plan.md` into types (FEATURE, BUG, PLAN_TASK, REVIEW, COMPLETION) and maps each type to the appropriate superpowers skill workflow chain. For example, a FEATURE triggers brainstorming -> writing-plans -> TDD, while a BUG triggers systematic-debugging -> TDD. Provides functions: `classify_task()`, `get_skill_workflow()`, `get_current_task()`, `has_design_doc()`, `has_implementation_plan()`, `all_tasks_complete()`, `count_remaining_tasks()`. |
| **TDD Gate** | `lib/tdd_gate.sh` | Analyzes Claude's output for TDD compliance. Pattern-matches against RED indicators (test written, test fails, failing test), GREEN indicators (test passes, all tests pass, tests green), and VIOLATION indicators (skip test, implement first, test later, no test needed). Produces a JSON compliance report with pass/fail status. Functions: `check_tdd_compliance()`, `analyze_tdd_status()`, `log_tdd_summary()`, `get_tdd_enforcement_context()`. |
| **Verification Gate** | `lib/verification_gate.sh` | Detects unverified completion claims vs evidence-based claims. Matches UNVERIFIED patterns ("should pass", "looks correct", "probably works", "seems to") against VERIFIED patterns ("34/34 pass", "exit code 0", "0 failures", "all tests pass"). Blocks exit signals that lack verification evidence. Functions: `check_verification()`, `analyze_verification_status()`, `log_verification_summary()`, `validate_exit_signal()`. |
| **Installer** | `install.sh` | Installs `super-ralph` and `super-ralph-setup` commands globally to `~/.local/bin`. Copies libraries to `~/.super-ralph/`. Includes embedded `super-ralph-setup` script for project scaffolding (creates `.ralph/` directory structure with PROMPT.md, specs/, fix_plan.md). Supports `./install.sh uninstall` for clean removal. |
| **Enhanced Prompt** | `super-ralph-prompt.md` | Drop-in replacement for Ralph's `.ralph/PROMPT.md`. Contains the full superpowers methodology embedded as prompt context: task classification table, TDD workflow (RED-VERIFY-GREEN-VERIFY-REFACTOR-COMMIT), systematic debugging 4-phase process, verification enforcement, and skill selection logic. This is what Claude reads on every loop iteration. |

### Skills Library (Superpowers Methodology)

All 14 skills from the [Superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers) project, faithfully reproduced with zero modifications. Each skill is a standalone `SKILL.md` file with YAML frontmatter and markdown instructions. Supporting files (prompt templates, technique references) are included where the original has them.

The skills directory structure mirrors the original superpowers repo exactly:

```
skills/
  brainstorming/SKILL.md
  writing-plans/SKILL.md
  test-driven-development/SKILL.md
  test-driven-development/testing-anti-patterns.md
  systematic-debugging/SKILL.md
  systematic-debugging/root-cause-tracing.md
  systematic-debugging/defense-in-depth.md
  systematic-debugging/condition-based-waiting.md
  verification-before-completion/SKILL.md
  subagent-driven-development/SKILL.md
  subagent-driven-development/implementer-prompt.md
  subagent-driven-development/spec-reviewer-prompt.md
  subagent-driven-development/code-quality-reviewer-prompt.md
  executing-plans/SKILL.md
  requesting-code-review/SKILL.md
  requesting-code-review/code-reviewer.md

  finishing-a-development-branch/SKILL.md
  dispatching-parallel-agents/SKILL.md
  using-git-worktrees/SKILL.md
  using-superpowers/SKILL.md
  writing-skills/SKILL.md
```

### Integration Layer

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `ralph-integration-guide.md` | Explains the 3-layer architecture (Infrastructure / Prompt / Methodology), setup options for existing Ralph projects (replace PROMPT.md, augment existing, CLAUDE.md integration), compatibility notes (RALPH_STATUS extension, circuit breaker interaction, session continuity), and troubleshooting guide. |
| `ralph-skill-hooks.md` | Decision tables for automatic skill selection at each loop phase: task classification hook (IF feature/bug/plan/review -> skill workflow), between-task hook (review -> fix -> verify -> commit -> mark complete), loop-end hook (run tests -> set status), parallel task hook, and error recovery hook. |

## The Super-Ralph Loop

Each Ralph loop iteration follows this enhanced flow:

```
RALPH LOOP ITERATION START
|
+-- 1. READ: Load .ralph/fix_plan.md, .ralph/specs/*, .ralph/AGENT.md
|
+-- 2. CLASSIFY: What type of work is the current task?
|   |
|   +-- NEW FEATURE ----------> Brainstorming -> Writing Plans -> Git Worktrees -> TDD
|   +-- BUG FIX --------------> Systematic Debugging -> TDD
|   +-- IMPLEMENTATION TASK --> TDD (with subagent-driven or executing-plans)
|   +-- COMPLETION/REVIEW ----> Verification -> Code Review -> Finishing Branch
|
+-- 3. EXECUTE: Follow the skill workflow for the task type
|
+-- 4. REPORT: Output RALPH_STATUS block with methodology tracking
|
RALPH LOOP ITERATION END
```

The enhanced RALPH_STATUS includes:

```
---RALPH_STATUS---
STATUS: IN_PROGRESS | COMPLETE | BLOCKED
TASKS_COMPLETED_THIS_LOOP: <number>
FILES_MODIFIED: <number>
TESTS_STATUS: PASSING | FAILING | NOT_RUN
WORK_TYPE: IMPLEMENTATION | TESTING | DOCUMENTATION | DEBUGGING | REFACTORING
EXIT_SIGNAL: false | true
METHODOLOGY: BRAINSTORMING | PLANNING | TDD | DEBUGGING | REVIEW | VERIFICATION
SKILL_USED: <skill-name or none>
RECOMMENDATION: <one line summary>
---END_RALPH_STATUS---
```

## Detailed Skill Descriptions

### Brainstorming

**Trigger:** New feature request or creative work that requires design decisions.

Turns rough ideas into fully formed designs through collaborative dialogue. Instead of jumping to code, the agent asks questions one at a time, explores 2-3 approaches with trade-offs, and presents the design in 200-300 word sections for incremental validation. Key principles: one question at a time, multiple choice preferred, YAGNI ruthlessly, explore alternatives always. Output: design document saved to `docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>-design.md`.

### Writing Plans

**Trigger:** Approved design ready for implementation breakdown.

Creates comprehensive implementation plans with bite-sized tasks (2-5 minutes each). Every task has exact file paths, complete code, test commands, and expected output. Assumes the implementer has zero codebase context and questionable taste. Each step is one action: "Write the failing test" is a step, "Run it to make sure it fails" is another step. Plans enforce DRY, YAGNI, TDD, and frequent commits. Output: plan document saved to `docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<feature-name>.md`.

### Test-Driven Development

**Trigger:** Any implementation work -- features, bug fixes, refactoring, behavior changes.

Enforces strict RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycle. The Iron Law: **NO PRODUCTION CODE WITHOUT A FAILING TEST FIRST.** Write code before the test? Delete it. Start over. No exceptions -- don't keep it as "reference", don't "adapt" it, don't look at it. Delete means delete. Each cycle: write one minimal failing test (RED), verify it fails for the right reason, write simplest code to pass (GREEN), verify all tests pass, refactor keeping green. Includes comprehensive rationalization prevention table (12 common excuses with rebuttals), verification checklist, and testing anti-patterns reference (never test mock behavior, never add test-only methods to production, never mock without understanding dependencies).

### Systematic Debugging

**Trigger:** Any technical issue -- test failures, bugs, unexpected behavior, performance problems, build failures.

The Iron Law: **NO FIXES WITHOUT ROOT CAUSE INVESTIGATION FIRST.** Four mandatory phases: (1) Root Cause Investigation -- read errors carefully, reproduce consistently, check recent changes, gather evidence in multi-component systems, trace data flow backward to source; (2) Pattern Analysis -- find working examples, compare against references, identify differences; (3) Hypothesis and Testing -- form single hypothesis, test minimally, one variable at a time; (4) Implementation -- create failing test case first (TDD), implement single fix, verify. After 3 failed fix attempts: STOP and question the architecture. Includes supporting techniques: root-cause-tracing (trace backward through call chain), defense-in-depth (validate at every layer), condition-based-waiting (replace arbitrary timeouts with condition polling).

### Verification Before Completion

**Trigger:** Before ANY completion claim, positive statement about work state, commit, PR, or task completion.

The Iron Law: **NO COMPLETION CLAIMS WITHOUT FRESH VERIFICATION EVIDENCE.** The Gate Function: (1) IDENTIFY what command proves the claim, (2) RUN the full command fresh, (3) READ full output and check exit code, (4) VERIFY output confirms the claim, (5) ONLY THEN make the claim. Skip any step = lying, not verifying. Red flags: using "should", "probably", "seems to"; expressing satisfaction before verification; trusting agent success reports; relying on partial verification. "Tests pass" requires test command output showing 0 failures, not "should pass now".

### Subagent-Driven Development

**Trigger:** Implementation plan with mostly independent tasks, staying in current session.

Dispatches fresh subagent per task with two-stage review after each: spec compliance review first (did they build what was requested?), then code quality review (is it well-built?). The coordinator reads the plan, extracts tasks with full text, creates a todo list, then per task: dispatch implementer subagent (with full task text, not file reference), wait for completion, dispatch spec reviewer (who does NOT trust the implementer's report -- reads actual code), fix issues, dispatch code quality reviewer, fix issues, mark complete. After all tasks: dispatch final code reviewer for entire implementation. Includes three prompt templates: implementer, spec-reviewer, code-quality-reviewer.

### Executing Plans

**Trigger:** Implementation plan to execute in batches with human checkpoints.

Alternative to subagent-driven development. Loads plan, reviews critically, executes tasks in batches of 3 (default), reports progress between batches with verification output, waits for feedback, continues. Stops immediately on blockers instead of guessing. Uses finishing-a-development-branch when all tasks complete.

### Requesting Code Review

**Trigger:** After each task, after major features, before merge.

Dispatches code-reviewer subagent with git SHA range (base..head) to review changes. Reviewer checks code quality, architecture, testing, requirements, and production readiness. Issues categorized as Critical (must fix), Important (should fix), Minor (nice to have). Critical issues block progress, Important issues fixed before proceeding, Minor noted for later.

### Receiving Code Review

**Trigger:** When receiving code review feedback from any source.

Code review requires technical evaluation, not emotional performance. Forbidden responses: "You're absolutely right!", "Great point!", "Let me implement that now" (before verification). Instead: restate the technical requirement, ask clarifying questions, push back with technical reasoning if wrong. YAGNI check: if reviewer suggests "implementing properly", grep codebase for actual usage -- if unused, remove it. Implementation order: clarify unclear items first, then blocking issues, simple fixes, complex fixes, testing each individually.

### Finishing a Development Branch

**Trigger:** All tasks complete, ready to integrate.

Verify tests -> Present exactly 4 options (merge locally, push and create PR, keep as-is, discard) -> Execute chosen workflow -> Clean up worktree. Will not proceed with failing tests. Discard requires typed confirmation. Cleanup worktree for merge/PR/discard, keep for "as-is".

### Using Git Worktrees

**Trigger:** Starting feature work that needs isolation from current workspace.

Creates isolated git worktrees with systematic directory selection (check for existing `.worktrees` or `worktrees`, ask user if neither exists) and safety verification (ensure directory is in `.gitignore`). Auto-detects project setup (package.json -> npm install, Cargo.toml -> cargo build, etc.) and verifies clean test baseline before reporting ready.

### Dispatching Parallel Agents

**Trigger:** 3+ independent failures in different subsystems/test files.

When multiple unrelated problems exist, dispatch one agent per independent domain. Each agent gets specific scope, clear goal, constraints, and expected output format. After agents return: review summaries, check for conflicts, run full test suite, spot check. Do NOT use when failures are related (fix one might fix others), need full system context, or agents would interfere with each other.

### Using Superpowers

**Trigger:** Every conversation -- establishes skill invocation requirement.

The master orchestrator skill. If there is even a 1% chance a skill might apply to what you're doing, you ABSOLUTELY MUST invoke the skill. This is not negotiable. Skill check comes BEFORE any response or action, including clarifying questions. Priority: process skills first (brainstorming, debugging), implementation skills second.

### Writing Skills

**Trigger:** Creating new skills, editing existing skills, or verifying skills work.

Writing skills IS Test-Driven Development applied to process documentation. You write test cases (pressure scenarios with subagents), watch them fail (baseline behavior), write the skill (documentation), watch tests pass (agents comply), and refactor (close loopholes). The Iron Law: NO SKILL WITHOUT A FAILING TEST FIRST. Skill description must start with "Use when..." and describe ONLY triggering conditions, never summarize the skill's process.

## Installation

### Factory Droid (Plugin)

Copy the plugin into Droid's marketplace:

```bash
# Clone
git clone https://github.com/aezizhu/super-ralph.git

# Copy to marketplace
cp -r super-ralph/skills/* ~/.factory/plugins/marketplaces/factory-plugins/plugins/super-ralph/skills/
```

Or install as personal skills (simpler):

### Factory Droid (Personal Skills)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aezizhu/super-ralph.git
for skill in super-ralph/skills/*/; do
  name=$(basename "$skill")
  mkdir -p ~/.factory/skills/$name
  cp -r "$skill"* ~/.factory/skills/$name/
done
```

Restart Droid to discover the skills.

### Claude Code

**Method 1: Install as plugin (recommended)**

In Claude Code, run:
```
/plugin add https://github.com/aezizhu/super-ralph
```

This registers Super-Ralph as a Claude Code plugin. All 14 skills will be auto-discovered. Start a new session for skills to take effect.

To update later:
```
/plugin update super-ralph
```

**Method 2: Clone and reference from CLAUDE.md**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aezizhu/super-ralph.git ~/.super-ralph
```

Add to your project's `CLAUDE.md`:
```markdown
Read and follow skills from ~/.super-ralph/skills/ directory.
```

### Codex

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aezizhu/super-ralph.git ~/.codex/super-ralph
mkdir -p ~/.agents/skills
ln -s ~/.codex/super-ralph/skills ~/.agents/skills/super-ralph
```

ln -s ~/.config/opencode/super-ralph/skills ~/.config/opencode/skills/super-ralph
```

### Other Tools (Cursor, Warp, Amp, etc.)

For tools that read project-level instructions, clone into your project and reference from the tool's config file:

```bash
cd your-project
git clone https://github.com/aezizhu/super-ralph.git .super-ralph
echo ".super-ralph/" >> .gitignore
```

Then reference in your tool's instruction file (AGENTS.md, .cursorrules, etc.):
```
Read and follow the skills in .super-ralph/skills/ for all development work.
```

### Standalone Bash System

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aezizhu/super-ralph.git
cd super-ralph
./install.sh
```

This installs:
- `super-ralph` command -- the autonomous development loop
- `super-ralph-setup` command -- project scaffolding
- `~/.super-ralph/` -- libraries and templates

Usage:
```bash
super-ralph-setup my-project    # Create new project
cd my-project
super-ralph --verbose           # Run the loop
```

---

## Architecture

Super-Ralph operates in three layers:

```
Layer 3: METHODOLOGY (Superpowers Skills)
  - 14 composable skills with iron laws, gate functions, rationalization prevention
  - Task classification -> skill workflow selection
  - TDD enforcement, systematic debugging, verification gates

Layer 2: PROMPT (Enhanced PROMPT.md)
  - Injected into Claude on every loop iteration via --append-system-prompt
  - Contains task classification logic, methodology references, RALPH_STATUS format
  - Drop-in replacement for Ralph's default PROMPT.md

Layer 1: INFRASTRUCTURE (Ralph Loop)
  - Autonomous bash loop with rate limiting and circuit breaker
  - Session continuity and intelligent exit detection
  - Monitoring, logging, and call tracking
```

**Dual Mode Operation:**
- **With Ralph installed:** Reuses Ralph's circuit breaker, response analyzer, date/timeout utils, session management. Adds superpowers methodology layer on top.
- **Without Ralph:** Runs standalone with built-in rate limiting, call tracking, exit detection, and all superpowers features.
