# Changelog

All notable changes to Super-Ralph are documented in this file.

## [1.1.0] - 2025-02-09

### Added
- **Test suite**: 114 bats tests across 6 test files covering all gate libraries,
  stop-hook controller, shared utilities, and project auto-detection
- **Project type auto-detection**: Automatically configures allowed tools based on
  project files (package.json, Cargo.toml, pyproject.toml, go.mod, Gemfile, etc.)
- **Shared gate utilities** (`lib/gate_utils.sh`): Extracted common pattern matching
  and JSON building functions to reduce code duplication
- **GitHub Actions CI**: Automated testing on macOS and Linux with ShellCheck linting
- **CONTRIBUTING.md**: Development setup, architecture overview, testing guidelines
- **CHANGELOG.md**: Version history documentation
- **Makefile**: Targets for test, lint, install, uninstall, check
- Pure bash fallback for `<promise>` tag extraction when perl is unavailable

### Fixed
- **Security**: Command injection in tdd_gate.sh and verification_gate.sh via unsafe
  `jq` string interpolation — now uses `jq --arg` for safe parameter passing
- **Octal arithmetic bug**: Rate limit wait calculation failed for minutes 08/09 due
  to bash octal interpretation — now uses `10#$var` prefix
- **Datetime fallback**: `get_next_hour_time` third fallback returned current time
  instead of next hour — now correctly calculates next hour
- **Install script**: Referenced non-existent SKILL.md and wrong path for
  ralph-skill-hooks.md — corrected to actual file locations
- **Task classification**: Added word boundaries (`\b`) to prevent false positives
  (e.g., "completely" matching COMPLETION, "tissue" matching BUG "issue")
- **ShellCheck warnings**: Fixed unquoted command substitution, useless echo, read
  without -r, and declare-and-assign issues across all bash scripts
- Stop-hook sed exit code now checked; state file update verified after write

### Improved
- **TDD gate patterns**: Added word boundaries, support for more verb forms (writing,
  skipping, testing), new violation patterns (without tests, don't need test)
- **Verification gate patterns**: Support for passed/passing forms, exit code with
  colon separator, more evidence formats (ran N tests, ok N tests)
- **Live log efficiency**: Uses `tail -c 50000` instead of full file copy during
  progress monitoring
- **Configurable thresholds**: `MAX_CONSECUTIVE_TEST_LOOPS` and
  `MAX_CONSECUTIVE_DONE_SIGNALS` now configurable via .ralphrc
- **File locking**: Call counter uses flock for atomic operations with graceful
  macOS fallback
- **Setup script**: Generated .ralphrc uses auto-detected tools instead of hardcoded
  restrictive defaults
- **Stop-hook diagnostics**: Better debug logging for jq parse failures, sed errors,
  and promise extraction
